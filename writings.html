         Dear Shraddha,</p>

<p>I am sorry for what happened. I won‚Äôt take your much time but please read this all just once. You don't have to read it right away but  I will be grateful to you. I am sorry for hurting you and I mean it. Please forgive me.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I say something that you don‚Äôt agree with. But this is just my effort and experience sharing to you.Please read it all, please</p>

<p>Shraddha, I have loved you all the time and never I had bad thought towards you. I think you have also felt how much I have loved you. To me love was so important towards you that every fight we had I used to settle down and come towards a solution to recontinue building our relation. I never had  anyi ntentions of hurting you. But with miscommunications, problems it didn‚Äôt seem that way to you. I am sorry for that.</p>

<p>Shraddha after entering America, my environment changed my desired started building more when I was in here and I started thinking more about my desires, I also shared you about that. But like when you feed sugar to ant, more ant comes. I started giving more to my desires, thinking more about it and it grew. I never realized that it would affect me, that it would affect us and kept feeding it. In the end, the small desire became a monster and, it hurt us. I was blinded even when you said no (and also it was like blah blah) cause every relation I had seen had that. My friends wouldn‚Äôt care about their girlfriend when they say something, that came in me too. But you are not the one to just sit and cry. You played your move. I am sorry Shraddha.</p>

<p>I failed to understand how important it was to you even when you said it me. Right now, my eyes have opened. But you may say it‚Äôs too late. Shraddha, I know but I am sorry you were hurt. Please forgive me and just one time. It‚Äôs been long I have control over my desires now. And I have been taking meaningful steps for it. I am sorry you were hurt because of me.</p>

<p>Shraddha if someone asks me how much I love you? My answer is that it‚Äôs the first time that I have been homesick. Why? I have not been talking to my home(you) for so long. I have said to you that when you don‚Äôt talk its hard to focus on what I am doing. Not playing victim, but it‚Äôs because I have dedicated my every move for you, and when I say that I mean it. Every thing I do, I do it for you. I had already kept you as my wife in my mind. You have been my number 1 since day 1. You said don‚Äôt be delulu but ‚Ä¶.. Without you, this life is not worth it.</p>
<p>Still how much do I love you? The monster that hurt you is dead. The soul that you fell in love is in charge now. (you may say disgusting but understand my perspective once). When did that happen? When I realized, I was not listening to you and instead to others. Why didn‚Äôt I realize earlier when you were screaming? The first lesson I got from a girl was, even when a girl says no, if she loves you it‚Äôs a yes. That line always blocked it. I know I have made mistakes forgive me Shraddha.  </p>
<p>I also had friends around me who had relationship and when they shared, I wanted that too. I created crack in our relation because of what others had. I am sorry for throwing burden to you. But I couldn‚Äôt realize it until you thought of leaving me. I have realized that and I will not compare myself to anyone.</p>
<p> Shraddha what I said to you that Thursday, it‚Äôs every partners‚Äô nightmare. I kept me in that place and I wouldn‚Äôt have been happy about it too. Shraddha but I didn‚Äôt mean it. In heat of the moment, I said it. I am sorry for that. I regret saying that when all I wanted to hear was, I will kick that feeling out of you.(I know sounds disgusting, but that‚Äôs the overthinking brain)</p>
<p>You also said that you didn't want to meet me because I wanted to kiss you and if you said no, I would get angry. My face seemed angry even though I was always happy being with you. That's what hit me the most. I never realized that I was hurting the person I loved the most. I am sorry Shraddha but I never realized that. You told me before you were uncomfortable with me sometimes, and how did I try to solve it? I thought more love more effort, and I did. But I failed to understand that all you wanted was safety and security. I am sorry. After all I am also a human who is living life for the first time, please be lenient on me. (don‚Äôt be angry)</p>
<p>You told last chance last time. I didn‚Äôt even promise to you that I will not do it cause to be honest, I did not know how important it was to you and I didn‚Äôt want to give you a false promise. I did not know the gravity of the problem I was creating. Yeah, again you may say it‚Äôs too late. But better late than never right. Guess I am latto k bhoot. This time I understand the importance and I promise to you that something like this will never happen again ever. </p>

<p>But I have realized that and, I will provide you with security and safety because you are who is important to me. I may not have understood your every emotion, there may be other things that you don‚Äôt like about me  like overthinking, clinginess, or anything else. Just tell me and I will solve all of them. I promise you. I am done hearing others, and I will only hear what you have to say to build our relation. I know you are spectical of me rn, and you got nothing to gain by coming back in my life after you decided to move past me. But Shraddha you will gain a changed man, a mature man and I promise on my head that I am speaking truth. I have never lied to you and this will be a promise to keep for life by me. Just give this man a chance and he will prove his worth to you.</p>
<p> Shraddha now you may say, I do not love you anymore, I don‚Äôt trust you, I will hate myself to come back to you. I know, it will not be like it was, but believe in me; Or else, you know the classic line ‚ÄúHave patience‚Äù and love will grow back; just one chance Shraddha. With every step, I will earn your trust from ground 0. Yes, I realized it late but its never too late to start fresh again. I will promise you that only good times we had will be repeated, and the bad ones: it won‚Äôt ever see our relationship again. The only thing is do you still have love for me?</p>
<p> For you, to love is to let go but for me to love is to fight for it. I believe, to stay together we can solve every problem coming in front of us. Here I am, still trying my way of loving you. Fighting the monster that hurt you and killing it while reinforcing and growing the beautiful soul that was compromised by the monster.  Shraddha if my way still doesn‚Äôt work, I may have to learn to love by your way. That‚Äôs the part I hate and hope it doesn‚Äôt come to that.</p>
<p>In short, small moments make you realize what books doesn't and those moments can change people. Shraddha I have made mistakes. I have realized where I fcked up. I have changed. When I say changed, I should(have) not give into my desires, I (do)should not compare myslef to others, be(am) happy in my own skin. And most importantly I (should) accept "no" as an answer, and (am not)don't be a pushy boy. I have implemented these steps in me. I promise never to compromise your security and safety. There may be other things that make you eww about me, but Shraddha I promise I will change them too. But these are the major ones I have realized.
  I am not going to beg you to come back in my life(although thats what I have been doing), but I am going to say that if you believe that love is one of the strongest energies in this world, if you believe that people can change, and if you had thought of a life with me, I want you to invest in me just once.</p>
 <p> If I still couldn't change your mind, I am sorry and please forgive me Shraddha for my actions. I never meant to hurt you.
I am truly sorry and theres one thing I wanted to do for you ever since we have been together..... I wrote a song for you. Just listen to it and laugh about it cause you know my voice. I am sorry for making you sad and I hope this will make you smile. (And maybe one day you can say to your grandkids that a guy once sang a song for me with a bad voice and he was your grandpa haha me delulu.)
