         Dear Shraddha,</p>

<p>I am sorry for what happened. I wonâ€™t take your much time but please read this all just once. I will be grateful to you. I am sorry for hurting you and I mean it. Please forgive me.</p>

<p>I am sorry if I say something that you donâ€™t agree with. But this is just my effort and experience sharing to you.</p>

<p>Shraddha, I have loved you all the time and never I had bad thought towards you. I think you have also felt how much I have loved you. To me love was so important towards you that every fight we had I used to settle down and come towards a solution to recontinue building our relation. My intentions were clear but with miscommunications, problems it didnâ€™t seem that way to you. I am sorry for that.</p>

<p>Shraddha but cut to entering America, my environment changed my desired started building more when I was in here and I started thinking more about my desires, I also shared you about that. But like when you feed sugar to ant, more ant comes. I started giving more to my desires, thinking more about it and it grew. I never realized that it would affect me, it would affect us and kept feeding it. In the end, it hurt us. I was blinded even when you said no (and also it was like blah blah) cause every relation I had seen had that. My friends wouldnâ€™t care about their girlfriend when they say something, that came in me too. But you are not the one to just sit and cry. You played your move. I am sorry Shraddha.</p>

<p>I failed to understand how important it was to you even when you said it me. Right now, my eyes have opened. But you may say itâ€™s too late. Shraddha, I know but I am sorry you were hurt. Please forgive me and just one time. Itâ€™s been long I have control over my desires now. And I have been taking meaningful steps for it. I am sorry you were hurt because of me.</p>

<p>Shraddha if someone asks me how much I love you? My answer is that you are the first thing that comes to my mind when I wake up and last thing before I sleep. I have said to you that when you donâ€™t talk its hard to focus on what I am doing. Not playing victim, but itâ€™s because I have dedicated my every move for you, and when I say that I mean it. Every thing I do, I do it for you. I had already kept you as my wife in my mind. You said donâ€™t be delulu but â€¦.. Without you, this life is not worth it.</p>

<p>I also had friends around me who had relationship and when they shared, I wanted that too. I created crack in our relation because of what others had. I am sorry for throwing burden to you. But I couldnâ€™t realize it until you thought of leaving me. I have realized that and I will not compare myself to anyone.</p>

<p>You told last chance last time. I couldnâ€™t even promise to you that I will not do it cause to be honest, I did not know how important it was to you. I did not know the gravity of the problem I was creating. Yeah, again you may say itâ€™s too late. But better late than never right. Guess I am latto k bhoot. This time I understand and I promise to you that something like this will never happen again.</p>

<p>You also said that you didn't want to meet me because I wanted to kiss you and if you said no, I would get angry. My face seemed angry even though I was happy being with you. I am sorry Shraddha but I never realized that. You told me before you were uncomfortable with me sometimes, and how did I try to solve it? I thought more love more effort, and I did. But I failed to understand that all you wanted was safety and security. I am sorry.</p>

<p>But I have realized that and, I will provide you with security and safety because you are who is important to me. I may not have understood your every emotion, there may be other things that you donâ€™t like about me. Just tell me and I will solve all of them. I promise you. I am done hearing others, and I will only hear what you have to say to build our relation. Just give this man a chance and he will prove his worth to you.</p>

<p>In short, Shraddha I have made mistakes. I have realized where I fcked up. I have changed. I promise never to compromise your security and safety. I am not going to beg you to come back in my life, but I am going to say that if you believe that love is one of the strongest energies in this world, if you believe that people can change, and if you had thought of a life with me, I want you to invest in me just once.</p>

<p>
  Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Atal Raj Paudel</p>

<p>with love</p>
